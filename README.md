# approximation-algorithms-case-study

This was an exploratory case study on approximation algorithms for NP-complete scheduling problems.

We tested out different scheduling algorithms and reported on their successes.

The emphasis of this project is more so on the report and findings than on the coding. Back then, we were not experienced with Python so we used the familiar C++.
If we were to re-do this case study, we would probably have gone for Python to minimze the time we spent coding pre-processing and parsing, and instead spent that saved time on more research on approximation algorithms and scheduling algorithms.
